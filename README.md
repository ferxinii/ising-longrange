# Ising model with super long-range interactions ⚡️
This repository includes:
-  Analytic analysis (see pdf)
-  Python code to run MC simulations of the model

This was initally developed as a project for my Statistical Physics course, but I later revisited the project and improved it. This repository includes the project as a pdf, and the Python code that runs the simulations. I include here some pictures from the project.

## Running the code
1. Simply run main.py . You will be asked to input the number of spins and the number of Monte Carlo steps to perform (see pdf). Higher values result in slower simulations, I recommend starting with 50 spins and 10000 steps to experiment.
2. The progress is displayed in real-time.
3. Once finished, a folder is created with the results of the run: A file with the mean magnetization per spin and total energy of each of the MC samples, for each of the temperatures. Attention: the file name only depends on N, so be careful with over-writing previous results.
