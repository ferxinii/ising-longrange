# Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model with super long range interactions ⚡️
This was initally developed as an optional project for my Statistical Physics course. However, I revisited the project later and improved it. This repository includes the Python code that runs the simulations, as well as the MATLAB code used in the numerical analysis of the analytical model.

In numeric_matlab you will find everything related to the numerical exploration, including the plots used for the project.

In results you will find the results of running main.py, as well as the results of previous runs. Additionally, a MATLAB script reads those previous runs to generate the plot that is used for the project.
