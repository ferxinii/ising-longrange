# Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model with super long range interactions
This was initally developed as an optional project for my Statistical Physics course. However, I revisited the project later and improved it. This repository includes the Python code that runs the simulations, as well as the MATLAB code used in the numerical analysis of the analytical model.
